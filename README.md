## Introduction

I realized that I tend to visualize too much of a project at once, thinking about how I'm going to do this or that as a whole. I hope that over time I can stop doing that, but rather break it down into smaller problems.

I think that starting with the foundations is a good idea such as the operator methods, but I also think starting with layout is pretty helpful.

## Analysis

Currently, I'm still working on the project. I've been running into a lot of problems, though.
